# linkding on fly

> üîñ Run the self-hosted bookmark service [linkding](https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding) on [fly.io](https://fly.io/). Automatically backup the bookmark database to [B2](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html) with [litestream](https://litestream.io/).

### Pricing

Assuming one 256MB VM and a 3GB volume, this setup fits within Fly's free tier. [^0] Backups with B2 are free as well. [^1]

[^0]: otherwise the VM is ~$2 per month. $0.15/GB per month for the persistent volume.
[^1]: the first 10GB are free, then $0.005 per GB.

### Prerequisites

 - a [fly.io](https://fly.io/) account
 - a [backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com/) account
 - a clone of this repository

All commands should be run in the directory of your local clone of this repository.

### Install flyctl

Follow [the instructions](https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/installing-flyctl/) to install fly's command-line interface `flyctl`.

Then, [log into flyctl](https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/log-in-to-fly/).

```sh
flyctl auth login
```

### Launch a fly application

Launch the fly application. When asked, **do not** setup Postgres and **do not** deploy yet.

```sh
flyctl launch
```

This command creates a `fly.toml` file. Open it and add an `env` section.

```toml
[env]
  # linkding's internal port, should be 8080 on fly.
  LD_SERVER_PORT="8080"
  # Path to linkding's sqlite database.
  DB_PATH="/etc/linkding/data/db.sqlite3"
  # B2 replica path.
  LITESTREAM_REPLICA_PATH="linkding_replica.sqlite3"
  # B2 endpoint.
  LITESTREAM_REPLICA_ENDPOINT="<filled_later>"
  # B2 bucket name.
  LITESTREAM_REPLICA_BUCKET="<filled_later>"
```

### Add a persistent volume

Create a [persistent volume](https://fly.io/docs/reference/volumes/). Fly's free tier includes `3GB` of storage across your VMs. Since `linkding` is very light on storage, a `1GB` volume will be more than enough for most use cases. It's possible to change volume size later. A how-to can be found in the _"scale persistent volume"_ section below.

```sh
flyctl volumes create linkding_data --region <your_region> --size <size_in_gb>
```

Attach the persistent volume to the container by adding a `mounts` section to `fly.toml`.

```toml
[mounts]
  source="linkding_data"
  destination="/etc/linkding/data"
```

### Configure litestream backups

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è If you want to use another storage provider, check litestream's ["Replica Guides"](https://litestream.io/guides/) section and adjust the config as needed.

Log into B2 and [create a bucket](https://litestream.io/guides/backblaze/#create-a-bucket). Instead of adjusting the litestream config directly, we will add storage configuration to `fly.toml`. In the `env` section, set `LITESTREAM_REPLICA_ENDPOINT` and `LITESTREAM_REPLICA_BUCKET` to your newly created bucket's endpoint and name.

Then, create [an access key](https://litestream.io/guides/backblaze/#create-a-user) for this bucket. Add the key to fly's secret store.

```sh
flyctl secrets set LITESTREAM_ACCESS_KEY_ID="<keyId>" LITESTREAM_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="<applicationKey>"
```

### Create a linkding superuser

You can create the linkding superuser prior to deployment by adding the following to fly's secret store:

```sh
flyctl secrets set LD_SUPERUSER_NAME="<username>" LD_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD="<password>"
```

### Deploy to fly

Deploy the application to fly.

```sh
flyctl deploy
```

If all is well, you can now access linkding by running `flyctl open`. You should see its login page.

That's it! You can now log into your linkding installation and start using it.

If you wish, you can [configure a custom domain for your install](https://fly.io/docs/app-guides/custom-domains-with-fly/).

### Verify the installation

 - you should be able to log into your linkding instance.
 - there should be an initial replica of your database in your B2 bucket.
 - your user data should survive a restart of the VM.

### Verify backups / scale persistent volume

Litestream continuously backs up your database by persisting its [WAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write-ahead_logging) to B2, once per second.

There are two ways to verify these backups:

 1. run the docker image locally or on a second VM. Verify the DB restores correctly.
 2. swap the fly volume for a new one and verify the DB restores correctly.

We will focus on _2_ as it simulates an actual data loss scenario. This procedure can also be used to scale your volume to a different size.

Start by making a manual backup of your data:

 1. ssh into the VM and copy the DB to a remote. If only you are using your instance, you can also export bookmarks as HTML.
 2. make a snapshot of the B2 bucket in the B2 admin panel.

Now list all fly volumes and note the id of the `linkding_data` volume. Then, delete the volume.

```sh
flyctl volumes list
flyctl volumes delete <id>
```

This will result in a **dead** VM after a few seconds. Create a new `linkding_data` volume. Your application should automatically attempt to restart. If not, restart it manually.

When the application starts, you should see the successful restore in the logs.

```
[info] No database found, attempt to restore from a replica.
[info] Finished restoring the database.
[info] Starting litestream & linkding service.
```

### Troubleshooting

#### litestream is logging 403 errors

Check that your B2 secrets and environment variables are correct.

#### fly ssh does not connect

Check the output of `flyctl doctor`, every line should be marked as **PASSED**. If `Pinging WireGuard` fails, try `flyctl wireguard reset` and `flyctl agent restart`.

#### fly does not pull in the latest version of linkding

either:

 - specify a version number in the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/fspoettel/linkding-on-fly/blob/master/Dockerfile#L9)
 - run `flyctl deploy` with the `--no-cache` option

#### Create a linkding superuser manually

If you have never used fly's SSH console before, begin by setting up fly's ssh-agent.

```sh
flyctl ssh establish

# use agent if possible, otherwise follow on-screen instructions.
flyctl ssh issue --agent
```

Then, run `flyctl ssh console` to get an interactive shell in your running container. You can now create a superuser by running the `createsuperuser` command and entering a password.

```sh
cd /etc/linkding
python manage.py createsuperuser --username=<your_username> --email=<your_email>
exit
```
